# This is a recreation of the pricing page on Dynaway website.

Completely build from scratch with React.

I made it and only then realized that it's not going to be compatible
with the Hubspot scripting (?) language Hubl - which is used by content
editors (like my boss Egle) to edit the prices and so on.

But otherwise everything works and I am pretty proud of the thing.
